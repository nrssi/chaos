# chaos
Chaos is just a repository to host my shell scripts,
although I love to share my code and script with the community
I want to implement all things in this repository by myself.
Anyone with any ideas for improving the shell scripts may create an issue.
I'll try to implement it 

* Who Am I?

I am N R Shyamsundar Iyanger, A CSE undergrad currently studying at SDMIT. I mainly focus on systems programming and stuff. I also focus heavily on command-line programs and a huge vim fan. This repository serves a triple function:
1) As a place where I can share my shell scripts with my friends and the community.
2) As a learning resource for those that wish to study.
3) As a backup and restore option for me should the need arise.
